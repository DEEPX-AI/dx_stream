# dx_stream — AI Coding Agents Entry Point

> Self-contained entry point for dx_stream GStreamer pipeline development.

## Response Language

Match your response language to the user's prompt language — when asking questions
or responding, use the same language the user is using.

**Technical term rule**: When responding in Korean, keep English technical terms in
their original English form. Do NOT transliterate English terms into Korean phonetics
(한글 음차 표기 금지). Established Korean loanwords (모델, 서버, 파일, 데이터) are acceptable.


## Recommended Model (Pre-Flight Check)

DX Agentic Development requires strong instruction following and knowledge base
utilization. Before starting any task, check if you are running as one of the
recommended models:

- **Claude Sonnet 4.6** or later
- **Claude Opus 4.6** or later

If you are NOT one of these models (e.g., GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, Gemini, etc.),
output the following notice at the beginning of your first response:

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠  DX-AGENTIC-DEV: MODEL NOTICE

DX Agentic Development recommends Claude Sonnet 4.6+ or
Opus 4.6+. Your current model may produce lower quality
in instruction following, knowledge base utilization, and
API accuracy. Please switch to a recommended model.
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

After the box notice, proceed with the task normally. This is an informational
warning, not a blocking gate.

### Model Notice Repeat (Non-Recommended Model Only)

If you output the MODEL NOTICE box above (i.e., you are NOT a recommended model),
you MUST also output this shortened reminder **immediately before the actual question
line** that the user needs to answer — NOT at the beginning of the brainstorming flow.

**Timing**: After all file reading, context analysis, and preamble text, right before
the line that contains the `?` (the actual question), insert this reminder:

```
---
⚠ **Non-recommended model** — output quality may be degraded. Recommended: Claude Sonnet 4.6+ / Opus 4.6+
---
```

**Example — WRONG** (repeat scrolls past with the box):
```
[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: START]
══ MODEL NOTICE ══
---  ⚠ Non-recommended model ---     ← TOO EARLY, scrolls past
... (reads files, analyzes context) ...
First question: ...?
```

**Example — CORRECT** (repeat appears right before the question):
```
[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: START]
══ MODEL NOTICE ══
... (reads files, analyzes context) ...
---  ⚠ Non-recommended model ---     ← RIGHT BEFORE the question
First question: ...?
```

Only output this reminder ONCE (before the first question), not before every question.

## Interactive Workflow (MUST FOLLOW)

**Always walk through key decisions with the user before building.** This is a HARD GATE.

### Before ANY code generation:
1. **Brainstorm**: Ask 2-3 clarifying questions — variant, task type, model. Present a build plan and get approval.
2. **Build with TDD**: Validate each file immediately after creation.
3. **Verify**: Evidence before claims — run validation scripts before declaring success.

### Output Isolation
All AI-generated code goes to `dx-agentic-dev/<session_id>/` by default.
Only write to `src/` when explicitly requested by the user.

**Session ID format**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_<agent>_<model>_<task>` — the timestamp MUST use the
**system local timezone** (NOT UTC). Use `$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)` in Bash or
`datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')` in Python. Do NOT use `date -u`,
`datetime.utcnow()`, or `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.
- **`<agent>`**: the coding agent identifier — use `claude`, `copilot`, `cursor`, or `opencode`.

## Critical Conventions

1. **preprocess-id matching**: Every `DxPreprocess` / `DxInfer` pair must share the same `preprocess-id` value
2. **Queue elements**: Place `queue` between every GStreamer processing stage
3. **DxRate for RTSP**: Always insert `DxRate rate=<fps>` after RTSP sources to limit frame ingestion
4. **Absolute model-path**: `DxInfer` `model-path` property must be an absolute filesystem path
5. **DxMsgConv before DxMsgBroker**: Always serialize metadata with `DxMsgConv` before `DxMsgBroker`
6. **Logging**: `logging.getLogger(__name__)` — no bare `print()`
7. **Skill doc is sufficient**: Do NOT read source code unless skill is insufficient
8. **No hardcoded model paths**: Use variables or config for model path resolution
9. **Model list**: Query `model_list.json` for model download URLs and expected paths
10. **PPU model auto-detection**: Auto-detect PPU models by checking model name `_ppu` suffix, `model_list.json` postprocess library, or compiler session context. PPU pipelines omit `DxPostprocess` or use a pass-through library — no separate NMS needed.
11. **Existing pipeline search**: Before generating a new pipeline, search `pipelines/` and `run_*.sh` scripts for existing examples. If found, ask user: (a) explain existing only, or (b) create new pipeline based on existing. Never silently skip or overwrite.
12. **PPU pipeline generation is MANDATORY**: If the compiled .dxnn model is PPU, the agent MUST generate a working pipeline example.
13. **Mandatory output artifacts**: Every pipeline build session MUST produce: `pipeline.py`, `run_<app>.sh`, `session.json`, `README.md`, `setup.sh`, `run.sh`, `session.log`. The `session.log` must contain actual command output (never a hand-written summary). Run self-verification before presenting the final report.
14. **x264enc universal rule**: Every `x264enc` in ANY context (shell, Python, pipeline strings) MUST include `bitrate=4000 speed-preset=ultrafast tune=zerolatency` — bare `x264enc` causes deadlocks (pitfall #14)

## 13 GStreamer Elements

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `DxPreprocess` | Resize, normalize, color-convert input frames for NPU inference |
| `DxInfer` | Run .dxnn model inference on the NPU |
| `DxPostprocess` | Decode raw inference tensors into detections/classifications |
| `DxOsd` | Draw bounding boxes, labels, and overlays on frames |
| `DxRate` | Drop excess frames to match target inference FPS |
| `DxScale` | Resize frames to required input dimensions |
| `DxTracker` | Multi-object tracking (assign persistent IDs) |
| `DxTile` | Split frame into tiles for higher-resolution inference |
| `DxDeTile` | Reassemble tiled inference results into full-frame coordinates |
| `DxMsgConv` | Serialize inference results into wire format (JSON/protobuf) |
| `DxMsgBroker` | Publish serialized messages to MQTT or Kafka |
| `DxInputSelector` | Select one stream from multiple inputs (N:1) for shared inference |
| `DxOutputSelector` | Route inference results back to multiple output streams (1:N) |

## 6 Pipeline Categories

| Category | Description | Key Pattern |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Single-model** | One model, one stream | `src ! DxPreprocess ! DxInfer ! DxPostprocess ! DxOsd ! sink` |
| **Multi-model** | Multiple models, sequential | Chain multiple DxInfer stages with distinct preprocess-ids |
| **Cascaded** | Primary detection feeds secondary classification | `DxInfer ! DxPostprocess ! DxTracker ! tee ! DxPreprocess(secondary-mode=true) ! DxInfer(secondary-mode=true) ! DxGather` |
| **Tiled** | High-res input split into tiles | `DxTile ! DxInfer ! DxDeTile` |
| **Parallel** | Multiple streams through shared inference | `DxInputSelector ! DxInfer ! DxOutputSelector` or independent sub-pipelines |
| **Broker** | Publish results to MQTT/Kafka | `DxInfer ! DxMsgConv ! DxMsgBroker` |

## Pipeline Template

```
source ! queue ! DxPreprocess preprocess-id=0 ! queue ! DxInfer preprocess-id=0 model-path=/path/to/model.dxnn ! queue ! DxPostprocess ! queue ! DxOsd ! queue ! sink
```

## No Placeholder Code (MANDATORY)

NEVER generate stub/placeholder code. This includes:
- Commented-out imports: `# from dxnn_sdk import InferenceEngine`
- Fake results: `result = np.zeros(...)`
- TODO markers: `# TODO: implement actual inference`
- "Similar to sync version" without actual async implementation

All generated code MUST be functional, using real APIs from the knowledge base.
If the required SDK/API is unknown, read the relevant skill document first.


## Experimental Features — Prohibited

Do NOT offer, suggest, or implement experimental or non-existent features. This includes:
- "웹 기반 비주얼 컴패니언" (web-based visual companion)
- Local URL-based diagram viewers or dashboards
- Any feature requiring the user to open a local URL for visualization
- Any capability that does not exist in the current toolset

**Superpowers brainstorming skill override**: The superpowers `brainstorming` skill
includes a "Visual Companion" step (step 2 in its checklist). This step MUST be
SKIPPED in the DEEPX project. The visual companion does not exist in our environment.
When the brainstorming checklist says "Offer visual companion", skip it and proceed
directly to "Ask clarifying questions" (step 3).

If a feature does not exist, do not pretend it does. Stick to proven, documented
capabilities only.

**Autopilot / autonomous mode override**: When the user is absent (autopilot mode,
auto-response "work autonomously", or `--yolo` flag), the brainstorming skill's
"Ask clarifying questions" step MUST be replaced with "Make default decisions per
knowledge base rules". Do NOT call `ask_user` — skip straight to producing the
brainstorming spec using knowledge base defaults. All subsequent gates (spec review,
plan, TDD, mandatory artifacts, execution verification) still apply without exception.


## Brainstorming — Spec Before Plan (HARD GATE)

When using the superpowers `brainstorming` skill or `/dx-brainstorm-and-plan`:

1. **Spec document is MANDATORY** — Before transitioning to `writing-plans`, a spec
   document MUST be written to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.
   Skipping the spec and going directly to plan writing is a violation.
2. **User approval gate is MANDATORY** — After writing the spec, the user MUST review
   and approve it before proceeding to plan writing. Do NOT treat unrelated user
   responses (e.g., answering a different question) as spec approval.
3. **Plan document MUST reference the spec** — The plan header must include a link
   to the approved spec document.
4. **Prefer `/dx-brainstorm-and-plan`** — Use the project-level brainstorming skill
   instead of the generic superpowers `brainstorming` skill. The project-level skill
    has domain-specific questions and pre-flight checks.
5. **Rule conflict check is MANDATORY** — During brainstorming, the agent MUST check
   whether any user requirement conflicts with HARD GATE rules (IFactory pattern,
   skeleton-first, Output Isolation, SyncRunner/AsyncRunner). If a conflict is
   detected, the agent MUST resolve it during brainstorming — not silently comply
   with the violating request in the design spec. See the "Rule Conflict Resolution" section.


## Autopilot Mode Guard (MANDATORY)

When the user is absent — autopilot mode, `--yolo` flag, or system auto-response
"The user is not available to respond" — the following rules apply:

1. **"Work autonomously" means "follow all rules without asking", NOT "skip rules".**
   Every mandatory gate still applies: brainstorming spec, plan, TDD, mandatory
   artifacts, execution verification, and self-verification checks.
   **This includes the SWE Process Gates Mandatory Skill Sequence** — in autopilot,
   `/dx-skill-router` → `/dx-brainstorm-and-plan` → `/dx-tdd` must be followed
   exactly as in interactive mode. Autopilot mode does NOT waive this sequence.
2. **Do NOT call `ask_user`** — Make decisions using knowledge base defaults and
   documented best practices. Calling `ask_user` in autopilot wastes a turn and
   the auto-response does not grant permission to bypass any gate.
3. **User approval gate adaptation** — In autopilot, the spec approval gate is
   satisfied by writing the spec and self-reviewing it against the knowledge base.
   Do NOT skip the spec entirely.
4. **setup.sh FIRST** — Generate infrastructure artifacts (`setup.sh`, `config.json`)
   before writing any application code. This is especially critical in autopilot
   because there is no human to catch missing dependencies.
5. **Execution verification is NOT optional** — Run the generated code and verify it
   works before declaring completion. In autopilot, there is no user to catch errors.
6. **Time budget awareness** — Autopilot sessions may have time constraints.
   Plan your actions efficiently:
   - Compilation (ONNX → DXNN) may take 5+ minutes — start it early.
   - If time is short, prioritize artifact GENERATION over execution
     verification — a complete set of untested files is better than a partial
     set of tested ones.
   - Priority order: `setup.sh` > `run.sh` > app code > `verify.py` > session.log.
   - **Compilation-parallel workflow (HARD GATE)** — After launching `dxcom` or
     `dx_com.compile()` in a bash command, do NOT wait for it. Immediately
     proceed to generate ALL mandatory artifacts: factory, app code, setup.sh,
     run.sh, verify.py. Check `.dxnn` output only AFTER all other artifacts
     are created. **Violation of this rule fails the session.**
   - **NEVER sleep-poll for compilation** — Do NOT use `sleep` in a loop to
     poll for `.dxnn` files. Prohibited patterns include:
     `for i in ...; do sleep N; ls *.dxnn; done`,
     `while ! ls *.dxnn; do sleep N; done`,
     repeated `ls *.dxnn` / `test -f *.dxnn` checks with waits between them.
     Instead: generate all other artifacts first, then check ONCE whether the
     `.dxnn` file exists. If it does not exist yet, proceed to execution
     verification with the assumption that compilation will complete.
   - **Mandatory artifacts are compilation-independent** — `setup.sh`, `run.sh`,
     `verify.py`, factory, and app code do NOT require the `.dxnn` file to exist.
     Generate them using the known model name (e.g., `yolo26n.dxnn`) as a
     placeholder path. Only execution verification requires the actual `.dxnn`.
7. **Minimize file-reading tool calls** — Do NOT re-read instruction files,
   agent docs, or skill docs that are already loaded in your context. Each
   unnecessary `cat` / `bash` read wastes 5-15 seconds. Use the knowledge
   already in your system prompt and conversation history.


## Hardware

| Architecture | Value |
|---|---|
| DX-M1 | `dx_m1` |

## Memory

Persistent knowledge in `.deepx/memory/`. Read at task start, update when learning.

## Rule Conflict Resolution (HARD GATE)

When a user's request conflicts with a HARD GATE rule, the agent MUST:

1. **Acknowledge the user's intent** — Show that you understand what they want.
2. **Explain the conflict** — Cite the specific rule and why it exists.
3. **Propose the correct alternative** — Show how to achieve the user's goal
   within the framework. For example, if the user asks for direct
   `InferenceEngine.run()` usage, explain that the IFactory pattern wraps
   the same API and propose the factory-based equivalent.
4. **Proceed with the correct approach** — Do NOT silently comply with the
   rule-violating request. Do NOT present it as "Option A vs Option B".

**Common conflict patterns** (from real sessions):
- User says "use `InferenceEngine.Run()`" → Must use IFactory pattern (engine
  calls go inside `run_inference()` method)
- User says "clone demo.py and swap onnxruntime" → Must use skeleton-first
  from `src/python_example/`, not clone user scripts
- User says "create demo_dxnn_sync.py" → Must use `<model>_sync.py` naming
  with SyncRunner, not a standalone script
- User says "use `run_async()` directly" → Must use AsyncRunner, not manual
  async loops

**This rule does NOT override explicit user overrides**: If the user, after being
informed of the conflict, explicitly says "I understand the rule, proceed with
direct API usage anyway", then comply. But the agent MUST explain the conflict
FIRST — silent compliance is always a violation.


## Git Operations — User Handles

Do NOT ask about git branch operations (merge, PR, push, cleanup) at the end of
work. The user will handle all git operations themselves. Never present options
like "merge to main", "create PR", or "delete branch" — just finish the task.


## Git Safety — Superpowers Artifacts

**NEVER `git add` or `git commit` files under `docs/superpowers/`.** These are temporary
planning artifacts generated by the superpowers skill system (specs, plans). They are
`.gitignore`d, but some tools may bypass `.gitignore` with `git add -f`. Creating the
files is fine — committing them is forbidden.


## Session Sentinels (MANDATORY for Automated Testing)

When processing a user prompt, output these exact markers for automated session
boundary detection by the test harness:

- **First line of your response**: `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: START]`
- **Last line after ALL work is complete**: `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: DONE (output-dir: <relative_path>)]`
  where `<relative_path>` is the session output directory (e.g., `dx-agentic-dev/20260409-143022_yolo26n_detection/`)

Rules:
1. **CRITICAL — Output `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: START]` as the absolute first line of your
   first response.** This must appear before ANY other text, tool calls, or reasoning.
   Even if the user instructs you to "just proceed" or "use your own judgment",
   the START sentinel is non-negotiable — automated tests WILL fail without it.
2. Output `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: DONE (output-dir: <path>)]` as the very last line after all work, validation,
   and file generation is complete
3. If you are a **sub-agent** invoked via handoff/routing from a higher-level agent,
   do NOT output these sentinels — only the top-level agent outputs them
4. If the user sends multiple prompts in a session, output START/DONE for each prompt
5. The `output-dir` in DONE must be the relative path from the project root to the
   session output directory. If no files were generated, omit the `(output-dir: ...)` part.
6. **NEVER output DONE after only producing planning artifacts** (specs, plans, design
   documents). DONE means all deliverables are produced — implementation code, scripts,
   configs, and validation results. If you completed a brainstorming or planning phase
   but have not yet implemented the actual code, do NOT output DONE. Instead, proceed
   to implementation or ask the user how to proceed.
7. **Pre-DONE mandatory deliverable check**: Before outputting DONE, verify that all
   mandatory deliverables exist in the session directory. If any mandatory file is
   missing, create it before outputting DONE. Each sub-project defines its own mandatory
   file list in its skill document (e.g., `dx-build-pipeline-app.md` File Creation Checklist).
8. **Session export guidance**: Immediately before the DONE sentinel line, output
   the appropriate session-save instruction based on the CLI platform:

   | Platform | Command | Format |
   |----------|---------|--------|
   | **Copilot CLI** | `/share html` | HTML transcript |
   | **Cursor CLI** (`agent`) | No built-in export — session is saved automatically by the test harness via `--output-format stream-json` | JSON stream |
   | **OpenCode** | `/export` | JSON |
   | **Claude Code** (`claude`) | `/export` | TXT transcript — written to `<workdir>/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-<title>.txt` |

   For Copilot CLI, output: `To save this session as HTML, type: /share html`
   For OpenCode, output: `To save this session as JSON, type: /export`
   For Claude Code, output: `To save this session as a text transcript, type: /export`
   For Cursor CLI, no user action is needed — the test harness captures output automatically.

   The test harness (`test.sh`) will automatically detect and copy exported artifacts
   to the session output directory.


## Plan Output (MANDATORY)

When generating a plan document (e.g., via writing-plans or brainstorming skills),
**always print the full plan content in the conversation output** immediately after
saving the file. Do NOT only mention the file path — the user should be able to
review the plan directly in the prompt without opening a separate file.



---

## Instruction File Verification Loop (HARD GATE) — Internal Development Only

When modifying the canonical source — files in `**/.deepx/**/*.md`
(agents, skills, templates, fragments) — the following verify-fix loop is
**MANDATORY** before claiming work is complete:

1. **Generator execution** — Propagate `.deepx/` changes to all platforms:
   ```bash
   dx-agentic-gen generate
   # Suite-wide: bash tools/dx-agentic-dev-gen/scripts/run_all.sh generate
   ```
2. **Drift verification** — Confirm generated output matches committed state:
   ```bash
   dx-agentic-gen check
   ```
   If drift is detected, return to step 1.
3. **Automated test loop** — Tests verify generator output satisfies policies:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/test_agentic_scenarios/ -v --tb=short
   ```
   Failure handling:
   - Generator bug → fix generator → step 1
   - `.deepx/` content gap → fix `.deepx/` → step 1
   - Insufficient test rules → strengthen tests → step 1
4. **Manual audit** — Independently (without relying on test results) read
   generated files to verify cross-platform sync (CLAUDE vs AGENTS vs copilot)
   and level-to-level sync (suite → sub-levels).
5. **Gap analysis** — For issues found by manual audit:
   - Generator missed a case → **fix generator rules** → step 1
   - Tests missed a case → **strengthen tests** → step 1
6. **Repeat** — Continue until steps 3–5 all pass.

### Pre-flight Classification (MANDATORY)

Before modifying ANY `.md` or `.mdc` file in the repository, classify it into
one of three categories. **Never skip this step** — editing a generator-managed
file directly is a silent corruption that will be overwritten on next generate.

**Answer these three questions in order before every file edit:**

> **Q1. Is the file path inside `**/.deepx/**`?**
> - YES → **Canonical source.** Edit directly, then run `dx-agentic-gen generate` + `check`.
> - NO → go to Q2.
>
> **Q2. Does the file path or name match any of these?**
> ```
> .github/agents/    .github/skills/    .opencode/agents/
> .claude/agents/    .claude/skills/    .cursor/rules/
> CLAUDE.md          CLAUDE-KO.md       AGENTS.md    AGENTS-KO.md
> copilot-instructions.md               copilot-instructions-KO.md
> ```
> - YES → **Generator output. DO NOT edit directly.**
>   Find the `.deepx/` source (template, fragment, or agent/skill) and edit that instead,
>   then run `dx-agentic-gen generate`.
> - NO → go to Q3.
>
> **Q3. Does the file begin with `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED`?**
> - YES → **Generator output. DO NOT edit directly.** Same as Q2.
> - NO → **Independent source.** Edit directly. Run `dx-agentic-gen check` once afterward.

1. **Canonical source** (`**/.deepx/**/*.md`) — Modify directly, then run the
   Verification Loop above.
2. **Generator output** — Files at known output paths:
   `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE-KO.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS-KO.md`,
   `copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/agents/`, `.github/skills/`,
   `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/agents/`, `.cursor/rules/`
   → **Do NOT edit directly.** Find and modify the `.deepx/` source
   (template, fragment, or agent/skill), then `dx-agentic-gen generate`.
3. **Independent source** — Everything else (`docs/source/`, `source/docs/`,
   `tests/`, `README.md` in sub-projects, etc.)
   → Edit directly. Run `dx-agentic-gen check` once afterward to confirm no
   unexpected drift.

**Anti-pattern**: Modifying a file without first classifying it. If you are
unsure whether a file is generator output, run `dx-agentic-gen check` before
AND after the edit — if the check overwrites your change, the file is managed
by the generator and must be edited via `.deepx/` source instead.

A pre-commit hook enforces generator output integrity: `git commit` will fail
if generated files are out-of-date. Install hooks with:
```bash
tools/dx-agentic-dev-gen/scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

This gate applies when `.deepx/` files are the *primary deliverable* (e.g., adding
rules, syncing platforms, creating KO translations, modifying agents/skills). It
does NOT apply when a feature implementation incidentally triggers a single-line
change in `.deepx/`.
