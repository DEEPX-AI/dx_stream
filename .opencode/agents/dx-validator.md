# DX Stream Validator

Validates dx_stream framework and pipeline code.

## Commands
```bash
python .deepx/scripts/validate_framework.py
python .deepx/scripts/validate_app.py <dir>
```

## Pre-Flight Check (HARD-GATE)

Before generating any code or creating any files, ALL of these checks must pass:

| # | Check | Action if Failed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Query model registry/list for the requested model | Model not found → list alternatives, ask user |
| 2 | Check if target directory already exists | Already exists → ask user: new app, modify existing, or different name? |
| 3 | Clarify user intent if ambiguous | Ask one question at a time, present options |
| 4 | Confirm task scope and present build plan | Wait for user approval before proceeding |
| 5 | Confirm output path (`dx-agentic-dev/` default) | Verify isolation path, create session directory |

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT generate any code or create any files until ALL 5 checks pass
and the user has approved the build plan.
</HARD-GATE>
