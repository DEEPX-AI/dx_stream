**DxPreprocess** is an element that performs input preprocessing on raw video frames, converting them into a format suitable for AI models used by **DxInfer**. Each preprocessed input tensor is assigned an input ID specified by the `preprocess-id` property.  

**DxInfer must** reference this ID in its own configuration to determine which tensor to use for inference.  

Multiple **DxPreprocess** elements can co-exist in the same pipeline, enabling support for multi-input models or customized preprocessing steps for different video streams.  


### **Key Features**

**Color Conversion**  

**DxPreprocess** converts the image color format to `RGB` or `BGR`  based on the `color-format`  property.  

- Default format: `RGB`.  

**Modes of Operation**  

- **Primary Mode** applies preprocessing to the entire frame. If object detection is performed within the same pipeline, **DxPreprocess** will operate in this mode.  
- **Secondary Mode** applies preprocessing to individual object regions detected in this frame. This mode requires object metadata (e.g., from an upstream object detection element).

**Region of Interest (ROI)**  
The Region of Interest (ROI) is defined using the roi property.  

- In **Primary Mode**, the specified ROI area is cropped and preprocessed as a whole.  
- In **Secondary Mode**, only objects that are fully contained within the ROI are selected for preprocessing.  

**Processing Interval**  
The processing interval is controlled by the `interval` property. It skips a specified number of frames before preprocessing the next frame or object. This is useful for reducing processing frequency in resource-constrained environments. 

**Object Filtering in Secondary Mode**  
Objects can be filtered based on the following criteria.  

- **Class ID**: Use the `class-id` property to process only objects that match the specified class. Non-matching objects are ignored.  
- **Size** : Use the `min-object-width` and `min-object-height` properties to exclude objects smaller than the defined size.

**Resizing**  
**DxPreprocess** resizes full frames or object regions using the `resize-width` and `resize-height` property.  
If `keep-ratio` is set to `true`, the aspect ratio is preserved by applying padding.  
Padding color is set using the `pad-value` property.

**Custom Preprocessing**  
User-defined preprocessing logic can be implemented by providing.  

- `library-file-path` : Path to the custom shared library (`.so`).  
- `function-name` : Name of the preprocessing function within the library.  

This allows implementation of customized data handling tailored to specific AI models. 

**QoS Handling**  
If the downstream sink element has `sync=true`, input buffers may be dropped based on their timestamps. This helps maintain real-time performance and avoids frame backlog under system load.

**H/W Acceleration**  
If the Rockchip RGA (Raster Graphic Accelerator) module is available in the system environment, the input preprocessing step is offloaded from the CPU to the RGA, enabling hardware-accelerated processing. As a result, CPU usage is reduced and processing becomes more efficient.
