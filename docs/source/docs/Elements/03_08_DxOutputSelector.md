**DxOutputSelector** is a GStreamer element used in multi-channel streaming pipelines. It receives a unified stream from `DxInputSelector` and redistributes the buffers to N output pads based on metadata, such as `stream_id`.

### **Key Features**

**Buffer Routing**  

- Buffers arriving at the single sink pad are routed to the correct `src` pad using the `stream_id` field found in the associated `DXFrameMeta`.  
- This enables seamless demultiplexing of multiple logical video streams within a unified pipeline.  

**Custom Event Handling**  

- `DxOutputSelector` processes sticky events (e.g., caps, segment) using custom routing events generated by `DxInputSelector`. This ensures that each `src` pad receives the correct contextual information.

### **Properties**

| **Name**      | **Description**    | **Type**  | **Default Value** |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| `name`        | Sets the unique name of the DxOutputSelector element.    | String   | `"dxoutputselector0"`   |

**Notes.**  

- `DxOutputSelector` requires asynchronous operation between its upstream and downstream elements. To achieve this, a `queue` element must be added to each of its src pads. Failure to do so may result in abnormal pipeline hangs.

- The `stream_id` from the `DXFrameMeta` of the buffer received on the sink pad is parsed and used as the index of the src pad. Therefore, if the `stream_id` does **not** correspond to a valid src pad index in `DxOutputSelector`, an error will occur.

- `DxOSD` removes the original buffer and creates a new one for drawing. During this process, `DXFrameMeta` is discarded, which can cause issues if `DxOSD` is placed upstream of `DxOutputSelector`.
